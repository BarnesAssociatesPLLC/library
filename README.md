# library

This is the collections library for J.T. Barnes & Associates, PLLC.  The collections follow a classification selected after considerable thought given to the varying systems of information management that presently exist and are in use.  The include the Dewey Decimal Classification system (DDC), the Library of Congress Classification system (LCC) and the system created and proprietary to the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC).  A summary of each is set forth below.

I.  The DDC.  

The basic DDC encompassed both "Classes" and "Tables", as follows:

Classes
000 – Computer science, information & general works
100 – Philosophy & psychology
200 – Religion
300 – Social sciences
400 – Language
500 – Pure Science
600 – Technology
700 – Arts & recreation
800 – Literature
900 – History & geography

Tables
T1 Standard Subdivisions
T2 Geographic Areas, Historical Periods, Biography
T3 Subdivisions for the Arts, for Individual Literatures, for Specific Literary Forms
T3A Subdivisions for Works by or about Individual Authors
T3B Subdivisions for Works by or about More than One Author
T3C Notation to Be Added Where Instructed in Table 3B, 700.4, 791.4, 808–809
T4 Subdivisions of Individual Languages and Language Families
T5 Ethnic and National Groups
T6 Languages

The DDC has critics and proponents alike.  Critics generally focus on its rigid structure and limited flexibility and capacity for growth or adaptation.  Subjects such as womens' rights and trans-gender issues have been used to illustrate the DDCs flaws.  However, a modified and modernized treatment of certain subclassifications vastly mitigates these concerns, while still allowing for a relatively streamlined system to exist.

II.  The LCC.

The basic LCC system is a two-tiered system that uses top-level categories and then a series of subcategories that are designed to expand over time as knowledge and history evolves.  It is widely adopted througout higher level institutions and in governmental contexts.  

The basic LCC encompasses the following:
